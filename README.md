# Design
In the realm of the Gamers Insight Blog, the design philosophy is centered around crafting a sleek and contemporary user interface that spotlights gaming insights. Inspiration springs from the immersive realms of video games, aiming to deliver a visually captivating experience to users. Primary goal is to facilitate easy navigation, discovery, and engagement within a vast collection of gaming articles.

### Design Choices
Our design choices were carefully crafted with gamers in mind. Created an environment that captures the essence of the gaming community.

### Color
Decision to adopt the 60-30-10 rule in our UI design is driven by its ability to create a cohesive and engaging user experience. This approach guarantees consistency by allocating 60% of our color palette to the dominant color, fostering brand recognition and trust. The 30% dedicated to the secondary color enables us to strike a visual balance, allowing for variations in content, headers, and backgrounds without overwhelming users. The remaining 10% allocated to the accent color serves to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, though we recommend choosing a contrasting shade for improved visibility and user engagement. This strategy ensures that our web application not only looks appealing but also functions effectively, guiding users to key elements while maintaining a harmonious and dependable design.

![Color Palette image](/docs/readme.md/readme-color-palette.png)
**Dominant (60%):** 

Choice of a deep blue shade, represented by #13112E as the dominant color, reflects our commitment to creating a unique and immersive gaming experience. This rich hue serves as the foundation for our web application's design, providing a dark and mysterious backdrop that resonates with the gaming community. It symbolizes trust and stability, inviting users to explore a world where they can delve into gaming insights.

**Secondary (30%):** 

The secondary color, also #13112E, is an intentional choice to maintain visual harmony and hierarchy throughout our design. It complements the dominant color with subtle variations, reinforcing the immersive atmosphere. This choice ensures that our users can navigate seamlessly through our content, discovering gaming insights with ease.

**Accent (10%):** 

While it might seem unconventional, our selection of #13112E as the accent color carries a unique significance. Chosen to keep a consistent blue theme throughout our UI, aligning with the essence of the gaming world. The accent color's role is to draw attention to interactive elements, such as buttons and links, creating a sense of cohesion and enhancing usability within our gaming community.

In short, our choice of colors isn't just about how things look; it's about creating a cool and welcoming place for gamers. A dark background is used as the main color (60%) to make the gaming experience more exciting. The blue colors picked, on making a design that gamers will really like.

# Methodology

The Gamers Insight project follows a methodology inspired by agile principles, fostering collaboration, flexibility, and gradual development. The outlined approach has guided the project's evolution:

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
To streamline project management, GitHub Projects is employed as a central hub. User stories and tasks are structured as GitHub issues, creating an organized workflow. The GitHub project board serves as a visual representation, tracking progress effectively.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Transforming user stories into GitHub issues captures user-centric functionalities. These issues interlink with respective user stories, simplifying access to criteria, tasks, and discussions.

### Bug Tracking for Seamless Development
Bugs uncovered during development are documented as GitHub issues, offering insights into each bug's characteristics, impact, and reproduction steps. By hyperlinking these issues in README.md, users can stay updated on bug resolutions and contribute insights.

### Iterative Development Approach
The Gamers Insight project adheres to an iterative development approach, facilitating continuous enhancements within a predefined timeline. Despite its condensed schedule, the project accommodates future iterations and expansions.

### Future Backlog and Progress
The project board efficiently manages user stories, with the "Not started" column representing upcoming iterations. This backlog previews user stories set for subsequent development phases.

Emphasizing that the project timeline is expedited, the iterative approach maintains adaptability, enabling ongoing refinements and improvements aligned with evolving user needs.

**Labels and User Story Distribution (MoSCoW):**

- **Must-Have:** 6/19
- **Should-Have:** 6/19
- **Could-Have:** 5/19
- **Wont-Have:** 1/19
- **Task:** 2/19

### Known bugs

| **Bug** | **Description** |
| ------- | --------------- |
| [If the server restarts and a user has previously logged in, the landing page is still shown initially, when the user visits the site again.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP4/issues/26) | This issue persists. |
| [Unable to send emails for the 'Password reset' function due to Gitpod blocking ports and in Heroku deployment. The steps work, but the email is not received. This could be due to an error in finding and installing OAuth templates and copying them into the template folder correctly. The path 'password_reset.html' is not found for OAuth templates, even though it is in my account/templates. This issue remains unresolved.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP4/issues/27) | This issue is still unresolved. |
| [Encountered a Server Error (500) when trying to access the LOGIN or SIGNUP page in the deployed version on Heroku.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP4/issues/28) | This issue is ongoing. Removed my "development" variable setup and if statement and just went with DEBUG = False. |
| [When a comment is deleted, users are redirected back to the post However, if they choose to go back by browser or mouse click(mouse4) from the post page, they encounter a 404 error page. This behavior has been documented as a bug in the system.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP4/issues/29) | This issue persists, but handled by my customized 404 page. |
| [When attempting to upload video or GIF images as profile pictures/blog posts in the application hosted on Heroku, users may encounter an "app error" or "server error" during the upload process.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP4/issues/30) | This issue persists. The issue persists, and it is suspected that it may be related to file format requirements or size restrictions. |



### Fixed bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| [Couldn't run Django.allauth, and couldn't get it to work.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP4/issues/20) | Added "'allauth.account.middleware.AccountMiddleware'," under the MIDDLEWARE in SETTING.PY, as this is a new requirement from allauth. |
| [Couldn't run "cp -r ../.pip-modules/lib/python3.8/site-packages/allauth/templates/* ./templates", error message saying "No such file or directory"](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP4/issues/21) | Resolved by using the shell, typing "python" -> "import site" -> "print(site.getsitepackages())" -> Copying the path and then redoing the command in the shell for installing the templates of auth. |
| [Couldn't style my crispy form as desired and couldn't add Bootstrap classes.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP4/issues/22) | Added every input separately inside a div and used "as_crispy_field". For example, added margin space to every input box and form-row. |
| [My stylesheet is not loading or cannot be found on Heroku. The error message is "its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled."](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP4/issues/23) | Resolved by setting DEBUG to False if development is not found with an if statement. |
| [Clicking submit on the create post button twice quickly results in a URL 404 error response, indicating that the post is already created.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP4/issues/24) | Created error handling pages for 403, 404, 405, and 500. |
| [Couldn't create a post with the same title as an already existing post. The error message received was:](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP4/issues/25) `IntegrityError at /post_create/duplicate key value violates unique constraint "blog_post_slug_key" DETAIL:  Key (slug)=(test) already exists.` | To maintain the uniqueness of slugs for posts, an if statement was added to the code, along with the use of timezone.now(). This ensures that if two posts have the same title, a timestamp is appended to one of them to create a unique slug. |

For deploying Your app, Heroku is used. Follow these steps:

 **Create a New App:**
   - Create a new app on Heroku dashboard.

 **Configure Settings:**
   - Navigate to "Settings" in new app.

 **Config Vars Setup:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `PORT` as the key and `8000` as its value.

 **Add PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Choose PostgreSQL as database.

        Example "ElephantSQL" was used in this project

 **Configure DATABASE_URL:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `DATABASE_URL` and copy the URL from PostgreSQL dashboard.

     Note: If using ElephantSQL as PostgreSQL provider, you can use the URL provided by ElephantSQL.

 **Environment Variable Setup:**
   - Create a new file in workspace called `env.py`.
   - Import the `os` library and set the environment variable for `DATABASE_URL` to the Heroku address (or ElephantSQL URL)
   - Add a secret key using `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key here"`.

 **Heroku Config Vars:**
   - Add the secret key to the Heroku app's config vars in the settings.

 **Django Settings:**
   - In `settings.py` of Django app, import `Path` from `pathlib`, `os`, and `dj_database_url`.
   - Add `if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env` to the file.
   - Replace the SECRET_KEY with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`.
   - Replace the database section with `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`.

 **Migrate Models:**
   - In workspace terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.
